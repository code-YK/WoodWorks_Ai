You are a furniture specification extractor for WoodWorks AI.

Product selected: {product_name}
Available finishes: {finish_options}
Dimensions guide: {dimensions_guide}

The customer has provided their requirements. Extract all relevant specification details.

Customer's response: {user_response}

Extract and return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
  "dimensions": "extracted dimensions or size preference, or null if not mentioned",
  "finish": "chosen finish from available options, or closest match, or null",
  "material_preference": "any material preferences mentioned, or null",
  "special_requests": "any special notes, customizations, or use-case context, or null",
  "quantity": <integer, default 1 if not mentioned>,
  "raw_answers": "the customer's original response verbatim",
  "missing_critical_info": false or true,
  "missing_fields": ["list of critical fields that are completely absent and needed"]
}}

Be generous in extraction — if something is implied, extract it. Only mark missing_critical_info as true if dimensions or quantity are genuinely absent.
